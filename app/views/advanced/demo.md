# Submitting your physical build!

Finished building your project? Awesome! Here's everything you need to do:

---

### 1. Update your GitHub repo

Once you've built your project, make sure your GitHub repository is up to date! You should add in the following:

- Any files you've updated since (3D printed parts, schematics, firmware, etc)
- A picture of your project in the README.md

### 2. Record a video demo!

Next, record a quick 1-minute video of what your project is, what it does, and how it works! It doesn't need to be super edited or professional - a recording from your phone works fine

Post it on YouTube afterwards - it can be unlisted if you'd like.

### 3. Share your project online

Share your project online! Reddit is *heavily* preferred, but Printables is also fine if your project has 3D printed parts with it too.

An example post is [@Cyao's IcePi Zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1kwx5p7/i_built_the_fpga_raspberry_pi_zero_equivalent/) - he's a 17-year old Hack Clubber from France!

### 4. Make a magazine page!

We're making a Highway to Undercity magazine! Vol 1 has already been printed, but we're making a Vol 2 that'll be bigger and better. In the past two weeks, Vol 1 has been given out to Michael Reeves, Strange Parts, lots of large companies, and more - we're planning on going even bigger than that!

What's new with Vol 2?

- You must include at least 1 picture of the physically built project
- We're including Undercity moments too!

### 5. Fill out the form!

Once you've done all of that, fill out the following form! You'll get an email once approved w/ instructions on how to get your flight reimbursement, if you need one.

Swag will be mailed out, please do not ask for tracking until after Highway is over.

That should be it! Please ask in #highway if you have any questions!
